## Building your toolbox

### Installing an IDE

Watch the video here: [Building your toolbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69WJeXGBdxg)

In the video he explains the need for a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

A code editor is an essential tool to any developers toolbox. It helps the developer:

- Write, debug and document your code
- Source control managemnent
- Built-in Terminal
- Customizable and extensible
- Free, cross-platform and open-source

### Installing IDE Extensions

An extension is a sub-program that is designed to be easily attached to a program to change the main program in some way. In this case we will be adding a couple of extensions to VSCode, in order to make our lives easier.

Those Extensions are:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint):
  Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code before it hits production.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode):
  Automatic code formatter, so you don't have to care about that extra space.
- [JavaScript (ES6) code snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets):
  Avoid reduntant typing with shortcuts to most used code fragments.

### Installing Node.js

You'll also need to install node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, which means you can use it to run JavaScript Programs in the terminal. It'll also help you to create and run JavaScript applications inside the browser.

When installing node.js it is best to use a Version Manager. This means you can update, run and change your node.js version easily. For that we will use NVM (Node Version Manager). To install following the instructions on the following link.
